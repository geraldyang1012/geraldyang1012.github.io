My primary research focus lies in **Decentralized Finance** (DeFi), specifically exploring financial applications built on blockchain technology. My interests within this domain include:

* **DeFi Protocol Design & Analysis**: I'm deeply interested in the mathematical and computational foundations of DeFi protocols. This includes analyzing risk factors like impermanent loss, exploring the efficiency of automated market makers (AMMs), and investigating the impact of governance mechanisms on protocol stability.
* **Quantitative Risk Management in DeFi**: My background in financial mathematics allows me to apply quantitative methods to assess risks associated with DeFi protocols and smart contracts. This encompasses areas like pricing decentralized derivatives, stress testing DeFi systems, and developing risk mitigation strategies.
* **Machine Learning for DeFi**: I leverage machine learning techniques to enhance decision-making in DeFi. This includes using predictive models for on-chain data analysis, fraud detection in smart contracts, and developing trading algorithms for decentralized exchanges.

A core tenet of my research is to merge rigorous probability and statistical methodologies with contemporary data science challenges in DeFi. By applying techniques like Stochastic processes, I aim to develop models that are not only effective but also transparent and interpretable, promoting trust and understanding in this rapidly evolving field.
