### Course Project
The course project offers a chance to deepen your engagement with the mathematical foundations of data science. You have the flexibility to work individually or in a group, and the project can take one of the following forms:

1. **Theoretical Deep Dive**: Select a topic with a strong theoretical basis in data science and provide a comprehensive exploration, elucidating its key concepts, principles, and mathematical underpinnings.
2. **Algorithm in Action**: Choose an algorithm relevant to data science, implement it, and apply it to a real-world dataset. Showcase the algorithm's practical utility and interpret the results.
3. **Theory Meets Practice**: Bridge the gap between theory and application. Introduce a topic or algorithm, explain its theoretical foundations, and then demonstrate its relevance and effectiveness by implementing it and analyzing its performance on real-world data.

The project should reflect your understanding of the course material and your ability to apply it in a meaningful and insightful way.
